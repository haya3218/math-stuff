# Drawing a circle

First, you create a new continually duplicating object (if you dont, it will instead go around in a circling path).
Manipulate its x and y values using math.sin and math.cos.

```
object.x = math.sin(time)
object.y = math.cos(time)
```
By default this will have a radius of 1.
in order to make it have a radius of 180, do 

```
180 * math.sin/cos 
```
in which 180 is the radius of the circle.

For it to have a little delay do

```
math.sin/cos(time * (math.pi/2))
```

This delays it by about 90 degrees in radians.

If you wanna change the speed, replace `math.pi/2` (or multiply it if you still want it to have a delay) with the number multiplier of your choice.

```
180 * math.sin/cos(time * (math.pi/2) * 2)
```

This above example gives the circle a radius of 180 pixels, with a delay of 90 degrees, with a speed of two.

**A single π radian is 180 degrees.**
**Two π radians is 360 degrees (aka a full circle).**
