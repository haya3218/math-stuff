# Artithmetics

I think you'd know this by now.

Simple arithmetics include:
- (+) for adding
- (-) for subtracting
- (*) for multiplying
- (/) for dividing
- (%) for modulos

# The Math Class

Not THE math class, but a class as in code.
Most languages have a built-in math class.

Most math classes include functions such as:
- Sin (returns the sine wave of a number)
- Cos (returns the cosine wave of a number)
- Tan (returns a tangent for a number)
- Mod (a shortcut for the modulo arithmetic)

More complex functions include:
- Lerp (Smoothly lerps two numbers together)

Variables include:
- PI (a variable that represents a Ï€)
- POSITIVE_INFINITY (a variable that represents the maximum number a float can hold)
- NEGATIVE_INFINITY (a variable that represents the minimum number a float can hold)

That's all.
